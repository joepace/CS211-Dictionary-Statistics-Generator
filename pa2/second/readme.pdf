See readme.pdf file for part 1 for in-depth detail.

Essentially, the only changes I made from part 1 to part 2 was in the matchStr() function. Instead of checking to see if the word from the dictionary file was a prefix of the word from the data file, I reversed it.

Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to properly attempt this program, so only the early testcases work properly.
